PCM notes
1. The pcm motif files do not appear to be PCM but instead probability matrix (PPM). They have been processed as such.
2. I have filtered the original pcm motif list to remove motifs labelled 'secondary' for a particular TF. The motifs associated with said TF labelled 'primary' are being used as the default motif for that TF.
