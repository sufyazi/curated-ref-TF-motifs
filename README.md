# Scripts to Extract and Collate Reference Motif Data

This repo contains all of the R scripts used to collate, extract, and modify the formats of reference motif data from various databases, for use with downstream footprinting tools, specifically TOBIAS.

## Motif Data Sources

Use the python script `pyjaspar_db_query.py` to get a list of jaspar motif IDs corresponding to whatever filter you set when querying the database.
